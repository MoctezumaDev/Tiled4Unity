# Tiled4Unity

By your friend [Leonidax](https://github.com/leonidax)

This is a modified version of the exporter Tiled2Unity created by [Seanba](https://github.com/Seanba)

The main difference with Tiled2Unity is that all the importing process is done in Unity avoiding the usage of an intermediary exporter application.

## Roadmap

* Eliminate an XML file created in the import process of the TMX files
